# editor suite & site furniture

this file covers the markdown-editing suite (desk, editor, editor-toolbar, asset-sidebar, drawing-window, file-grid) and a handful of standalone site-furniture components (inline-edit, manager-table, socials). the editing suite is a composition tree: `desk` is the full workbench that wires `editor-toolbar` (which owns floating `drawing-window`s), `asset-sidebar`, and the `editor` panes together over one `useLineSync` engine; `file-grid` is the standalone asset browser that pairs with it. everything is dark-only, controlled, and callback-driven — the components never own persistence; you bring your own state, markdown renderer, and backend calls. sources live in `packages/registry/<name>/`.

## asset-sidebar

**Role:** scrollable image/asset sidebar with per-row insert/delete buttons and an optional drag-and-drop upload zone
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add asset-sidebar`
**Composes:** nothing beyond utils

renders an `<aside>` (bordered, `bg-white/[0.02]`) with three stacked regions: a header (title + optional description), a scrollable list of asset cards, and — only when `onUpload` is passed — a dashed drop zone footer reading "drop images here to upload". each card shows the image in a fixed `aspect-video` frame on a light `#efede7` background (so light drawings and diagrams stay readable against the dark ui), the asset name, its `markdownPath` in mono, and insert/delete buttons.

every card is `draggable`; on drag start it writes `![name](markdownPath)` to the drag data as `text/plain`, so dropping a row into any textarea pastes a ready-made markdown image reference. clicking insert fires `onInsert(asset)` instead — the sidebar does not splice text itself, the parent does (desk uses this to insert at the caret). delete just fires `onDelete(asset)`; the parent owns any confirmation flow. the drop zone tracks drag-enter depth with a ref so nested drag events don't flicker the highlight, and calls `onUpload(files)` with the dropped `File[]`.

the `Asset` type is `{ id, url, name, markdownPath }` — `url` is what the `<img>` renders (can be a data url or object url), `markdownPath` is what gets written into markdown. the list region is `min-h-0 flex-1 overflow-y-auto`, so the sidebar must be given a height by its container (the demo wraps it in `h-[28rem] w-72`); inside a grid, the track needs `minmax(0,1fr)` or the internal scroll will not engage.

**Key props:**
- `assets: Asset[]` — rows to render.
- `onInsert: (asset: Asset) => void` — fired by the insert button.
- `onDelete: (asset: Asset) => void` — fired by the delete button; parent owns confirm.
- `onUpload: (files: File[]) => void` — files dropped on the drop zone. omit to hide it.
- `title: string = 'images'`
- `description: string`
- `className: string`
- `emptyLabel: string = 'no images yet.'`

**Example:**
```tsx
<div className="h-[28rem] w-72">
  <AssetSidebar
    assets={assets}
    description="drag into the editor or click insert."
    onInsert={(asset) => insertAtCaret(`![${asset.name}](${asset.markdownPath})`)}
    onDelete={(asset) => removeAsset(asset.id)}
  />
</div>
```

## desk

**Role:** the full markdown workbench — toolbar, image sidebar, and split editor with a two-way synced preview, all wired together
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add desk`
**Composes:** editor, asset-sidebar, editor-toolbar, drawing-window

the highest-level piece of the suite, a port of justin06lee.dev/desk. it renders an `EditorToolbar` on top (title/subtitle, an edit/preview/split mode toggle, the default markdown format buttons, a "new drawing" button, a "save: cmd/ctrl+s" status hint, and a built-in white save button), an `AssetSidebar` on the left (18rem column at `xl:`, stacked with `max-h-[20rem]` below that), and the editing area on the right — `EditorTextarea` and/or `EditorPreview` depending on the current mode, sharing one `useLineSync` engine so selection sync works both ways (see the editor section). mode state (`edit | preview | split`) is internal; it starts in `split`.

desk owns the text-splicing glue the leaf components deliberately don't: format buttons wrap the current selection (or the action's placeholder) with the action's `before`/`after` and restore focus + selection via `requestAnimationFrame`; the sidebar's insert button (and `onInsertAsset`) splices `\n![name](markdownPath)\n` at the caret. `onUploadAssets` handles both the sidebar drop zone and files dropped directly onto the textarea: return the created assets (sync or async) and a textarea drop also splices their markdown refs at the drop-time caret (a void return just uploads; the insert reads the latest value from a ref so keystrokes during a slow upload aren't lost). plain text drags — a sidebar row — keep the browser's native insert-at-drop-point behavior. cmd/ctrl+s calls `onSave(value)` — the listener binds once on `window` and reads the latest value from a ref, and it only calls `preventDefault` when an `onSave` handler exists, so the browser save dialog is untouched otherwise. the save button renders disabled without `onSave`. drawing windows are managed by the toolbar: `onSaveDrawing` gets `{ dataUrl, darkDataUrl? }` and the window closes after it resolves; `drawingDarkMapping` switches the windows to the light-to-dark mapping mode.

two escape hatches pass through to the editor pieces: `textareaProps` spreads onto the underlying textarea, with event handlers composing rather than replacing — desk's internal splice/save/drop glue runs first, then yours with the same event (so a vim keymap layers cleanly) and `className` is merged; `transformSource` derives the preview's markdown from the editor value — strip a leading front-matter region and return `{ body, lineOffset }` so the two-way line-sync stays aligned (editor line N maps to preview block line N − lineOffset; selections in the stripped region clamp to the first block). keep the transform's reference stable.

markdown rendering is injected: `renderMarkdown(md, { highlightLine })` must return a renderer that stamps `data-source-line` on top-level blocks — in this registry that's `<Prose lineSync highlightLine={highlightLine}>{md}</Prose>` (prose is a separate registry component, not a dependency of desk). sizing uses the shared `EditorSize` presets via `editorSizeClass` — `screen` (default) fills the container at viewport height; `sm` through `2xl` step from 20x32rem to 52x88rem; `auto` opts out. `className` merges after the preset through tailwind-merge, so `h-*`/`w-*` classes there win. note the internal layout leans on `minmax(0,1fr)` grid tracks and `min-h-0` everywhere — if you rebuild a custom desk from the pieces, replicate that or the panes will grow instead of scrolling.

**Key props:**
- `title: ReactNode`
- `subtitle: ReactNode`
- `value: string` (required) — markdown source (controlled).
- `onChange: (value: string) => void` (required)
- `renderMarkdown: (markdown: string, state: { highlightLine: number | null }) => ReactNode` (required) — renders the preview with line-sync — typically a `<Prose lineSync />` call.
- `assets: Asset[] = []`
- `onInsertAsset: (asset: Asset) => void` — the markdown ref is also spliced at the caret.
- `onDeleteAsset: (asset: Asset) => void` — parent owns any confirm flow.
- `onUploadAssets: (files: File[]) => void | Asset[] | Promise<Asset[] | void>` — fired for files dropped on the sidebar drop zone or directly onto the textarea. return the created assets and a textarea drop also splices their refs at the caret. omit to hide the drop zone and disable textarea drops.
- `onSave: (value: string) => void | Promise<void>` — fired by the built-in save button and cmd/ctrl+s; the button renders disabled without it.
- `onSaveDrawing: (result: { dataUrl: string; darkDataUrl?: string }) => void | Promise<void>`
- `drawingDarkMapping: boolean` — use the drawing window's light-to-dark mapping mode.
- `actions: ReactNode` — extra toolbar actions before Save.
- `textareaProps: Omit<ComponentProps<'textarea'>, 'value' | 'defaultValue'>` — escape hatch onto the underlying textarea (e.g. onKeyDown for a vim keymap). internal handlers run first, then yours; className merged.
- `transformSource: (source: string) => { body: string; lineOffset: number }` — strip a leading front-matter region from the preview; line-sync shifts by lineOffset. keep the reference stable.
- `size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl' | '2xl' | 'screen' | 'auto' = 'screen'` — size preset setting height and width (width clamped to the container). 'screen' fills the container at viewport height; sm-2xl step from 20x32rem up to 52x88rem; 'auto' opts out so className owns the sizing.
- `className: string` — extra classes; h-*/w-* classes here override size.

**Example:**
```tsx
const [md, setMd] = useState(INITIAL);

<Desk
  title="the desk"
  subtitle="guides / the-desk"
  value={md}
  onChange={setMd}
  size="xl"
  assets={assets}
  onSave={(value) => save(value)}
  onSaveDrawing={({ dataUrl, darkDataUrl }) => addAsset(darkDataUrl ?? dataUrl)}
  renderMarkdown={(source, { highlightLine }) => (
    <Prose lineSync highlightLine={highlightLine}>{source}</Prose>
  )}
/>
```

## drawing-window

**Role:** floating, draggable, resizable paint window with brush/eraser, undo/redo, zoom/pan, and canvas-size presets
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add drawing-window`
**Composes:** nothing beyond utils

renders a `position: fixed` window (inside a pointer-events-none fullscreen layer at the given `zIndex`) with a draggable title bar, a close button, the canvas area on the left, a tool rail on the right, and a resize handle in the bottom-right corner. the window clamps itself to the viewport with a 16px margin, enforces a 620x520 minimum, and re-clamps on browser resize. it stamps `data-drawing-window="true"` on its root — editor-toolbar's outside-click deactivation keys on that attribute. `active` highlights the border and gates wheel-zoom; `onFocus` fires on any pointer-down inside so a parent can manage a z-order.

drawing uses two canvases: an offscreen source canvas holding the true pixels, and the visible display canvas. in the default direct mode both are black-backed and you draw in dark-friendly colors (`#ffffff`, greens/reds/blues). with `darkMapping` on — the /desk behavior — the source canvas is white and you pick "light" colors (`#000000`, dark greens/reds/blues); every stroke and swatch is remapped per-pixel through an hsl transform (near-white becomes black, near-black becomes white, everything else gets a saturation/lightness lift) so the display shows the dark variant live while the light master is preserved. save then emits `{ dataUrl }` (the source png) plus `darkDataUrl` only when darkMapping is on; with no `onSave`, it downloads the png (the dark variant when available) named after the title.

the tool rail offers a canvas-size preset select (square 1024x1024, wide 1280x720, tall 720x1280 by default — changing preset resets the canvas and history), brush/eraser toggle, color swatches plus a native custom color input, three brush sizes, and undo/redo/clear backed by a 24-snapshot data-url history. snapshot restores are async (`Image.onload`), so rapid undo/redo clicks are ignored until the restore lands. zoom runs 0.5x-4x via the +/- buttons or the wheel (only while `active`); pan with space-drag or middle-drag. `saving` (controlled) and `disableSave` exist so a parent can serialize concurrent saves across windows — editor-toolbar uses them for its one-at-a-time save lock, rendering "Another window is saving..." on the locked buttons.

gotchas: pass `presets`/`colors` as stable references or module constants — the canvas-reset effect keys on the preset's key/width/height rather than object identity to survive inline arrays, but stable props are still the safe pattern. usually you don't render this directly: `editor-toolbar` with `enableDrawing` manages numbered, cascading, focus-ordered windows for you.

**Key props:**
- `title: string = 'drawing'`
- `subtitle: string`
- `initialPosition: { x: number; y: number } = { x: 72, y: 120 }`
- `initialSize: { width: number; height: number } = { width: 780, height: 720 }`
- `active: boolean = true` — highlights the border and enables wheel-zoom.
- `zIndex: number = 80`
- `onClose: () => void`
- `onFocus: () => void`
- `saving: boolean` — controlled saving flag.
- `disableSave: boolean = false`
- `darkMapping: boolean = false` — draw in light colors remapped to a dark variant.
- `presets: DrawingPreset[]`
- `colors: string[]` — hex swatches; defaults depend on darkMapping.
- `brushSizes: number[] = [4, 10, 18]`
- `onSave: (result: { dataUrl: string; darkDataUrl?: string }) => void | Promise<void>` — omit to download the png instead.
- `className: string`

**Example:**
```tsx
{open && (
  <DrawingWindow
    title="drawing #1"
    active
    onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
    onSave={({ dataUrl }) => {
      uploadPng(dataUrl);
      setOpen(false);
    }}
  />
)}
```

## editor

**Role:** split-pane markdown editor whose live preview scrolls and highlights in sync, both ways
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add editor`
**Composes:** nothing beyond utils; npm: lucide-react

installs three files: `editor.tsx` (the `Editor` split-pane plus the standalone `EditorTextarea`), `editor-preview.tsx` (`EditorPreview`), and the `use-line-sync.ts` hook. `Editor` is the turnkey form: a textarea beside a preview, sharing one `useLineSync({ value })` engine. select text in the textarea and a floating "preview" button appears next to the selection; clicking it scrolls the matching preview block level with the selection (viewport-coordinate aligned, clamped below the sticky label bar) and highlights it, leaving a persistent gray streak over the editor lines. clicking a block in the preview goes the other way: the editor scrolls so the matching text lines up center-to-center with the clicked block (mono text is denser than prose, so centers — not top edges — keep the two highlights visually level) and the streak covers the block's lines with trailing blanks trimmed. the pane the user is looking at never moves; only the other one scrolls.

the sync engine (`useLineSync`) owns all the machinery: caret-offset-to-line math, pixel measurement of selections via the classic mirror-div technique (a hidden div styled to wrap exactly like the textarea), an overlay layer translated on scroll so the streak and button track the text 1:1, and re-measurement on window resize. because alignment happens in viewport coordinates, an `EditorTextarea` and `EditorPreview` sharing one engine stay in sync even in separate, non-adjacent containers — this is how desk uses them, and how you build custom layouts: call `useLineSync` yourself, pass `sync` to `EditorTextarea`, and wire `sync.previewRef` + `sync.onPreviewSelectBlock` to `EditorPreview`.

two escape hatches: `textareaProps` (on `Editor` and `EditorTextarea` alike) spreads extra props onto the underlying `<textarea>` — keymaps, drop handlers, aria attributes — with event handlers composing instead of replacing: the internal sync/selection glue runs first, then yours with the same event, so a vim keymap layers without forking; `className` merges after the built-in classes and `value`/`defaultValue` are excluded (the source stays controlled). `transformSource` derives the preview's markdown from the editor value — strip a leading front-matter region (`# title`, `cover:`, `tags:`, …) and return `{ body, lineOffset }`; the preview renders `body` and the engine shifts line numbers by the offset (`useLineSync({ value, bodyLineOffset })`), so editor line N maps to preview block line N − lineOffset and selections in the stripped region clamp to the first block. keep the transform's reference stable (define it outside the render). the hook file also exports the pure mapping helpers `editorLineToPreviewLine(line, bodyLineOffset)` and `previewLineToEditorLine(line, bodyLineOffset)` (plus `offsetToLine`, `lineStartOffset`, `trimStreakRange`) for custom layouts and tests.

the renderer contract is the load-bearing part: `renderMarkdown(md, { highlightLine })` must stamp `data-source-line` (1-based) on top-level blocks and `data-sync-highlight` on the highlighted one, or sync silently does nothing. the registry's `prose` component does this via `<Prose lineSync highlightLine={highlightLine}>`. the highlight is driven declaratively — the preview holds the line number in state and hands it back to the renderer — because an imperatively-toggled class would be wiped when the renderer rebuilds its dom. `EditorPreview` is memoized so unrelated editor state changes (like clearing a selection on blur) don't reflow the preview mid-click; keep `onSelectBlock` referentially stable if you wire it manually.

sizing: `EDITOR_SIZE_CLASS` maps the presets — `sm: h-80 w-[32rem]`, `md: h-[28rem] w-[44rem]`, `lg: h-[36rem] w-[56rem]`, `xl: h-[44rem] w-[72rem]`, `2xl: h-[52rem] w-[88rem]` (all `max-w-full mx-auto`), and `screen: h-[calc(100dvh-10rem)] min-h-[24rem] w-full`. `editorSizeClass(size)` returns undefined for `auto`. the preset merges before `className` in `cn`, so tailwind-merge lets your `h-*`/`w-*` classes override it. the component draws no outer border — add `className="border border-white/10"` if you want the framed look from the demo.

**Key props:**
- `value: string` (required) — markdown source (controlled).
- `onChange: (value: string) => void` (required) — called with the next source on edit.
- `renderMarkdown: (markdown: string, state: { highlightLine: number | null }) => ReactNode` (required) — renders the markdown with line-sync — typically `(md, { highlightLine }) => <Prose lineSync highlightLine={highlightLine}>{md}</Prose>`.
- `label: ReactNode = 'live preview'` — sticky label over the preview pane.
- `placeholder: string` — editor textarea placeholder.
- `textareaProps: Omit<ComponentProps<'textarea'>, 'value' | 'defaultValue'>` — escape hatch onto the underlying textarea (e.g. onKeyDown for a vim keymap). internal handlers run first, then yours; className merged.
- `transformSource: (source: string) => { body: string; lineOffset: number }` — strip a leading front-matter region from the preview; line-sync shifts by lineOffset. keep the reference stable.
- `size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl' | '2xl' | 'screen' | 'auto' = 'screen'` — size preset setting height and width (width clamped to the container). 'screen' fills the container at viewport height; sm-2xl step from 20x32rem up to 52x88rem; 'auto' opts out so className owns the sizing.
- `className: string` — extra classes; h-*/w-* classes here override size.

**Example:**
```tsx
const [md, setMd] = useState("# hello");

<Editor
  value={md}
  onChange={setMd}
  size="lg"
  className="border border-white/10"
  renderMarkdown={(source, { highlightLine }) => (
    <Prose lineSync highlightLine={highlightLine}>{source}</Prose>
  )}
/>
```

## editor-toolbar

**Role:** the bar above a markdown editor — mode toggle, format buttons, action cluster, and (optionally) the floating drawing windows
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add editor-toolbar`
**Composes:** drawing-window

renders up to two rows. the top row holds the title/subtitle block and an action cluster: a "new drawing" button (when `enableDrawing`), a segmented mode toggle (rendered only when `onModeChange` is passed; the modes default to `["edit", "preview", "split"]` and the active one inverts to white-on-black), and your `actions` node (save buttons, links). the second row appears when there are format buttons or a `status`: each `EditorFormatAction` (`{ label, before, after?, placeholder? }`) renders as a small button with its label lowercased, and `status` right-aligns as a hint (e.g. "save: cmd/ctrl+s"). the exported `MARKDOWN_FORMAT_ACTIONS` default covers H2, Bold, List, Code, Link, and Math. the toolbar is presentational — `onFormat(action)` hands you the action and you do the text splicing (desk shows the canonical implementation); omit `onFormat` to hide the buttons, or pass `formatActions={[]}`.

the exception to "presentational" is drawing: with `enableDrawing`, the toolbar owns a list of `DrawingWindow`s. new windows get the lowest free 1-based number (closing #1 frees the number for reuse) and cascade 28px per open window; titles read "drawing #N" with `drawingSubtitle` underneath. focusing a window moves it to the end of the array so its `zIndex` (80 + index) puts it on top; a capture-phase pointerdown listener deactivates the active window when you click anywhere outside `[data-drawing-window]`. saves are serialized with a lock — while one window's `onSaveDrawing` is in flight, every other window's save button is disabled — and a window closes itself after its save resolves.

`drawingDarkMapping` forwards to each window's light-to-dark mode. note the drawing windows are fixed-position portals in the layout sense (rendered as siblings after the toolbar div, but `position: fixed`), so the toolbar can live inside any container without clipping them.

**Key props:**
- `title: ReactNode`
- `subtitle: ReactNode`
- `mode: string` — current view mode; pass onModeChange to render the toggle.
- `onModeChange: (mode: string) => void`
- `modes: string[] = ['edit','preview','split']`
- `actions: ReactNode` — right-hand button cluster.
- `formatActions: EditorFormatAction[] = MARKDOWN_FORMAT_ACTIONS`
- `onFormat: (action: EditorFormatAction) => void` — fired on a format button; omit to hide them.
- `status: ReactNode` — right-aligned hint in the format row.
- `enableDrawing: boolean = false` — show 'new drawing' and own the numbered drawing windows.
- `onSaveDrawing: (result: { dataUrl: string; darkDataUrl?: string }) => void | Promise<void>` — fired when a drawing window saves; it then closes.
- `drawingSubtitle: string` — subtitle under each window's 'drawing #N' title.
- `drawingDarkMapping: boolean` — use the drawing window's light-to-dark mapping mode.
- `className: string`

**Example:**
```tsx
const [mode, setMode] = useState("split");

<EditorToolbar
  title="getting started"
  subtitle="guides / getting-started"
  mode={mode}
  onModeChange={setMode}
  onFormat={(action) => wrapSelection(action)}
  status="save: cmd/ctrl+s"
  enableDrawing
  onSaveDrawing={({ dataUrl }) => uploadPng(dataUrl)}
  actions={<button className="bg-white px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-medium text-black">save</button>}
/>
```

## file-grid

**Role:** asset-browser grid of stacked-paper file cards with drag-to-trash delete and a type-the-name confirm dialog
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add file-grid`
**Composes:** file-card, input, button; lucide-react (npm)

renders a flex-wrap grid of `file-card`s from a `files` array of `{ id, name, href?, meta? }` — the component is generic over the file shape, so extra fields ride along into `onDelete` and `renderCard` untouched. `renderCard` replaces the default card per file (the default forwards name/meta/href and `linkComponent` to `file-card`). with an empty array it renders a dashed `emptyLabel` box.

passing `onDelete` enables the delete flow, and it is deliberately two-step: drag a card onto the trash zone (cards become draggable, the trash highlights red on hover-over) — or press the per-card trash button that fades in on hover/focus, which is the keyboard path — then a confirm dialog demands the exact file name be typed before the delete button enables. `onDelete` may return a promise: the dialog shows "deleting…" and disables the button while it runs, and a rejection surfaces its message inline and keeps the dialog open (roll nothing back yourself — the file list is your state). the dialog is a hand-rolled modal at z-[100]: focus moves to the input and restores on close, Tab is trapped, body scroll locks, Escape and backdrop click cancel; its entrance fade disables under prefers-reduced-motion. `trashPosition` puts the drop zone at the grid's bottom-right corner (default) or fixed to the viewport's bottom right for long scrolling pages.

this is the standalone asset-browser counterpart to desk's `asset-sidebar` — reach for file-grid on a files/downloads page or an asset manager view; reach for asset-sidebar when the list lives beside an editor and inserts into markdown.

**Key props:**
- `files: T[]` (required) — { id, name, href?, meta? }[] — extra fields ride along into onDelete/renderCard (generic over the file type).
- `onDelete: (file: T) => void | Promise<void>` — enables deleting: drag to trash (or the per-card button), then type the exact name. may be async — pending state + inline error in the dialog.
- `renderCard: (file: T) => ReactNode` — replaces the default file-card render for each file.
- `linkComponent: React.ElementType = 'a'` — anchor element/component forwarded to the default card — pass your router's Link.
- `trashPosition: 'corner' | 'viewport' = 'corner'` — trash drop zone pinned in the grid's corner, or fixed to the viewport's bottom right.
- `emptyLabel: string = 'no files yet.'` — shown when files is empty.
- `className: string` — overrides on the root element.

**Example:**
```tsx
const [files, setFiles] = useState([
  { id: "1", name: "quarterly-report.pdf", meta: "pdf · 1.2 mb", href: "#" },
]);

<FileGrid
  files={files}
  onDelete={async (file) => {
    await api.deleteFile(file.id); // throw to keep the dialog open with the error
    setFiles((prev) => prev.filter((f) => f.id !== file.id));
  }}
/>
```

## inline-edit

**Role:** blur-to-save editable text field with pending state, error rollback, and escape-to-cancel
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add inline-edit`
**Composes:** nothing beyond utils

a controlled `<input>` that looks like plain text until hovered (transparent bottom border that fades in on hover, brightens on focus — matching the input primitive's language). it holds a local draft over the caller-owned `value` and commits through `onCommit` on blur or Enter. while the commit promise is in flight the field disables itself; if `onCommit` throws, the draft rolls back to the previous `value`. Escape discards the draft and blurs — a transient flag suppresses the commit the blur would otherwise trigger. commits are no-ops when the draft is unchanged or empty (it just snaps back), and the draft is trimmed first unless `trim={false}`.

the behavior lives in a headless `useInlineEdit({ value, onCommit, trim })` hook installed alongside (`use-inline-edit.ts`), returning `{ draft, setDraft, pending, commit, cancel, onKeyDown }` — use it directly to build inline-editable elements that aren't a bare input. the hook is careful about races: a generation token means an external `value` change supersedes any in-flight commit, an in-flight counter guarantees `pending` always resolves, and the draft re-syncs to `value` when it changes externally but never mid-edit.

the component spreads the remaining input props (aria-label, placeholder, onBlur/onKeyDown are chained after the internal handlers), so it drops into forms and table cells directly — manager-table uses it for row renaming. installed to `components/ui/inline-edit.tsx` and `hooks/use-inline-edit.ts`.

**Key props:**
- `value: string` — controlled source of truth, owned by the caller.
- `onCommit: (next: string) => void | Promise<void>` — commit handler (onblur / enter). throw to roll back to the previous value.
- `trim: boolean = true` — trim the draft before comparing / committing.

**Example:**
```tsx
const [name, setName] = useState("untitled");

<InlineEdit
  value={name}
  onCommit={async (next) => {
    await api.rename(next); // throw to roll back
    setName(next);
  }}
/>
```

## manager-table

**Role:** admin table of rows you can inline-rename, recolor, archive, and delete (with confirm)
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add manager-table`
**Composes:** inline-edit, color-swatch, dialog

renders a plain `<table>` with four columns — Name, Color, Status, Actions — over a `ManagerRow[]` model: `{ id, name, color?, archived?, locked? }`. the name cell is an `InlineEdit` (blur/Enter commits through `onRename(id, name)`), the color cell is a `ColorSwatchPicker` over the `palette` entries committing through `onRecolor(id, hex)`, status is an archive/unarchive toggle firing `onArchive(id, !archived)`, and the delete action first asks for confirmation through the dialog provider (`useDialog().confirm` with a danger button) before firing `onDelete(id)`. archived rows render at 40% opacity. a row with `locked: true` (built-in / system rows) renders its name as plain text with a small "locked" hint and no delete button — recolor and archive still work.

every handler — `onRename`, `onRecolor`, `onArchive`, `onDelete` — may return a promise: while one is in flight the row's actions disable (the swatch picker goes pointer-events-none), and a rejection surfaces its message inline in a red row directly under the affected row (fallbacks: "rename failed" / "recolor failed" / "archive failed" / "delete failed"). a rejected rename also rolls the draft name back to `value` (via InlineEdit's throw-to-rollback contract); a rejected delete leaves the row in place. errors clear when the next mutation on that row starts.

every mutation is a callback and the rows array is the source of truth — the table holds no row state beyond pending/error flags, so the parent applies each change (or persists it and re-renders). because it calls `useDialog`, it must be rendered inside a `DialogProvider` (installed with the `dialog` registry dependency); forgetting the provider is the most common integration failure. palette entries are `ManagerPaletteEntry = string | { value, name? }` — a name shows in the swatch tooltip/aria-label instead of the raw hex. when `palette` is omitted the picker uses color-swatch's `CATEGORY_PALETTE` (the same eight muted hexes as the exported `DEFAULT_MANAGER_PALETTE`, with friendly names). a custom `palette` should be a stable reference since the swatch list is memoized on it.

**Key props:**
- `rows: ManagerRow[]` (required) — rows to render; the source of truth, owned by the caller. a row with locked: true renders without rename/delete affordances.
- `palette: ManagerPaletteEntry[] = CATEGORY_PALETTE` — swatch colors: bare hexes or { value, name } (name shows in the tooltip). defaults to CATEGORY_PALETTE's named muted hexes.
- `onRename: (id: string, name: string) => void | Promise<void>` — commit a renamed row. reject to roll the name back and surface the error under the row.
- `onRecolor: (id: string, color: string) => void | Promise<void>` — commit a recolored row. reject to surface the error under the row.
- `onArchive: (id: string, archived: boolean) => void | Promise<void>` — toggle a row's archived flag. reject to surface the error under the row.
- `onDelete: (id: string) => void | Promise<void>` — delete a row (already confirmed). reject to block it — the row stays and the error surfaces under it.
- `className: string`

**Example:**
```tsx
<DialogProvider>
  <ManagerTable
    rows={rows}
    onRename={(id, name) => update(id, { name })}
    onRecolor={(id, color) => update(id, { color })}
    onArchive={(id, archived) => update(id, { archived })}
    onDelete={(id) => remove(id)}
  />
</DialogProvider>
```

## socials

**Role:** row of social icon links driven by a links map — only supplied platforms render
**Install:** `bunx @justin06lee/chrome@latest add socials`
**Composes:** nothing beyond utils; npm: lucide-react

renders a `<nav aria-label="Social links">` of square icon buttons in a fixed platform order: github, linkedin, x, email, youtube, instagram, website. you pass a `links` map (`Partial<Record<SocialKey, string>>`); entries that are missing or empty strings are skipped, and if nothing remains the component renders null. every non-email entry is a plain `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">` — framework-agnostic, no router involved. the brand glyphs (github, linkedin, youtube, instagram) are shipped as inline SVGs wrapped to match the `LucideIcon` interface — newer lucide releases dropped them, so the paths are copied verbatim from lucide-react 0.540.0 and the component works on any lucide version; the x glyph was never in lucide and is inlined too (filled, unlike the stroked rest). only the generic Mail and Globe icons import from lucide-react.

the email entry is special: its `links.email` value is a bare address (not a mailto url), and clicking copies it to the clipboard, flipping the hover tooltip to "Copied!" for 1.5s; if the clipboard api is unavailable (e.g. an insecure context) it falls back to navigating to `mailto:`. every button shows a white slide-up tooltip on hover and keyboard focus.

`size` (sm/md/lg maps to 9/10/11 tailwind squares with 16/18/20px icons) and `gap` (tight/normal/loose) tune density; the row wraps with `flex-wrap`. the component also accepts `className` on the nav for placement, though it's not listed in the meta props.

**Key props:**
- `links: Partial<Record<'github' | 'linkedin' | 'x' | 'email' | 'youtube' | 'instagram' | 'website', string>>` (required) — platform to url (or bare email address for `email`); empty entries are skipped.
- `size: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' = 'md'`
- `gap: 'tight' | 'normal' | 'loose' = 'normal'`

**Example:**
```tsx
<Socials
  links={{
    github: "https://github.com/justin06lee",
    x: "https://x.com/justin06lee",
    email: "hi@justin06lee.dev",
    website: "https://justin06lee.dev",
  }}
/>
```
